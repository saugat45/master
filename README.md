### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Saugat Thapa.
#### I am Cybersecurity Enthusiast.
Iâ€™m currently pursuing a master's degree in Cybersecurity, building on my experience as a Security Research Analyst. When I'm not diving into the latest in security threats and solutions, youâ€™ll find me on the soccer field or strategizing my next move in a game of chess. I'm passionate about staying at the cutting edge of technology and always eager to discuss cybersecurity, sports, or anything in between. I am looking forward to connecting and exploring new ideas!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
